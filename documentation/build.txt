The bootsector and bootloader do NOT have makefiles. 
* Assembling 'bootsec.asm' will output the bootsector in binary.
* Assembling 'BTLSTG2.asm' will output the stage 2 bootloader in binary.

The core has a makefile in its root directory. The 'lib', 'hal' and the 'kernel' folder have a make configuration file named 'make.config'. The aforementioned folders also have their own makefile.

However, to build the core, the makefile in the root directory must be executed. This makefile will automatically execute the makefiles in the sub directories.
